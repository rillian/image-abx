First generation - web application
==================================

Goals:

 - Double-blind image comparison testing system.
 - Hot-or-not style user interface that allows wetware to view two
   images, perform the specified comparison, and provide feedback.
 - Entire process is server-side controlled, including image selection,
   variable selection, and image creation.
 - Back end is easy to install with Apache, open source
 - Pre-generated stimuli
 - Target wetware is known and separately interviewed by researcher.

Requirements:

 - Test modes: Time-ordered ABX, side-by-side ABX
 - Fixed-size images: 600x600 for time-ordered, 300x300 for side-by-side
 - Images in PNG format
 - Front-end should preload images, then fade into picture from black,
   fade out to black, etc. on a timer.  The idea is that the wetware
   will get a fixed amount of time to view images, but a longer amount
   of time to select A/B/unknown.
 - Backend should allow session generation (without authentication) to
   keep track of multiple users simultaneously.


Second generation - public web application
==========================================

Goals:

 - Stability, security, scalability.
 - Target wetware is unknown to researcher.
 - Simple interview capability.

Requirements:

 - Session generation with OpenID authentication.  Session expiration.
   Limit maximum number of concurrent sessions.
 - Interview system before stimuli presentation.  This should allow the
   researcher to provide a list of questions and possible answers in a
   single language.


Third generation - standalone Linux app
=======================================

Goals:

 - Allow more precise control of environment, such as making sure
   scaling is 1:1, display is working correctly, etc.
 - Allow automatic collection of more data, such as display information.
